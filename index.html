        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 
            Hello my name is Kevin! I am currently located in Los Angeles, California. I graduated from California State University, Northridge with a bachelors degree in Psychology (Go Matadors!). After working multiple therapy jobs in the field of psychology, I felt like it was not for 
            me and decided to give software a try as computer science was my original major back in my college days.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, sports, playing video games, traveling, and trying new resturants. For music, I really enjoy listening to edm and pop. Some of my favorite artist include Illenium, Gryffin, Nurko, and Dabin.
            There is just something about edm music that always puts me in a good mood no matter how terrible my day has been. Some sports I enjoy include football, hockey, basketball, and snowboarding.
