            <p class="bio"> 
            Hello my name is Kevin! I am currently located in Los Angeles, California. I graduated from California State University, Northridge with a bachelors degree in Psychology (Go Matadors!). After working multiple therapy jobs in the field of psychology, I felt like it was not for 
            me and decided to give software a try as computer science was my original major back in my college days. Software and coding has always been very interesting to me and working at a big tech company has always been a huge goal of mine. Growing up in Los Angeles, my father was also a software engineer and always taught me things when I was young. I feel like it is important for me to follow in his footsteps since that was always something he wanted for me. 

            </p>
            <p class="bio"> 
            In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, sports, playing video games, traveling, and trying new resturants. For music, I really enjoy listening to edm and pop. Some of my favorite artist include Illenium, Gryffin, Nurko, and Dabin.
            There is just something about edm music that always puts me in a good mood no matter how terrible my day has been. Some sports I enjoy include football, hockey, basketball, and snowboarding. Being from Los Angeles, the sport culture is very big here and so I definitely support all the LA teams except for the clippers. During winter, I love going to either Big Bear mountain or Mammoth mountain to snowboard.
