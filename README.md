At the moment, there are only 2 projects for me to showcase, but I am excited to add more as well as modify and improve the landing page to make it much more intricate.

So far the nav bar is working properly and scrolls to the correct section when the user clicks on certain sections. Thumbnails that are used to showcase my projects are working properly and opens a new tab when the thumbnail is activated.
