## Description
The purpose of this page is to showcase my work for future employers. At the time of this post, there is currently only 3 pieces of work for me to showcase;however, more work will be added as I complete more.

The page contains a short about me section which will give the viewer a short discription about myself. Included on the page are also my contacts and where to reach me for future inquires. There is a also a downloadable pdf file which contains my resume for any future employer that wishes to view it.
