# my-portfolio

## Description 
This is a landing page for my portfolio. This page was made in order to showcase the work that I have completed so far and to give my future employers an idea of what I am capable of. This page is also meant to introduce myself to my future employers so they have a small idea of who I am. 

At the moment, there are only 2 projects for me to showcase, but I am excited to add more as well as modify and improve the landing page to make it much more intricate.

So far the nav bar is working properly and scrolls to the correct section when the user clicks on certain sections. Thumbnails that are used to showcase my projects are working properly and opens a new tab when the thumbnail is activated.
